My last entree into blogging fizzled out pretty quickly under time constraints and complaints about the content, so I've been hesitant to get back into it. I'm finally biting the bullet and starting back up again, but I'm going to stay within the confines of "snackable" posts, mostly involving quick dives into datasets. Rule of Thumb: If I can't finish it over two glasses of whiskey, it's not getting finished.
