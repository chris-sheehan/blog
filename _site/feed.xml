        <title>NBA Champions</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;No posts for the past month while I was buried under the NBA playoffs. Now that the Warriors are NBA champions, there’s only one thing to do: run the numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>NBA Teams: Age vs. SRS</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I saw a chart a while back comparing beisbol teams’ expected win totals to their team ages. The idea was to find:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;teams who were expected to lose a ton of games and it would be OK because they are young and “up and coming”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;teams who were expected to lose a ton of games and it’s a huge problem because they’re old and getting older.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;teams who were expected to win a lot of games and damn well better because they, too, are old and it is now or never.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;teams who were expected to win a lot of games and should continue to do so for a while with a young core.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a bunch of other teams in less extreme situations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that had me wondering what a similar look at the NBA might show. As a Golden State Warriors fan, I’ve spent this season hearing a lot of talk about how the Dubs are set up for long term success with a young core of players. This sort of optimism is completely foreign to me, and so I spent the season looking for reasons why this nonsense. This chart does not do that. (Playoff teams in red)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;nba-teams-age-vs-srsblogassetsimgnba-age-srspng&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/nba-age-srs.png&quot; alt=&quot;NBA Teams: Age vs. SRS&quot; /&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.basketball-reference.com/blog/?p=39&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SRS&lt;/a&gt; is simply taken from the teams’ regular season performance as calculated by basketball-reference.com. The age of each team is a weighted average based on players’ minutes played during the regular season. A few stray observations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Warriors do look to be a position to capitalize in a young core.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Utah Jazz are the only team with a positive SRS whose age is &amp;lt; 25, and they clear it with ease at 23.4.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some really bad teams on the older side (Lakers and Knicks) are somewhat misleading as they tanked hard all year, both with a number of older players who won’t be on the roster 2015-16.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Somehow, I’m not terribly worried the Spurs, despite being the second oldest team in the league; I would be considerably more worried about the Clippers if I cared about LA sports.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, the qualifier attached to all of this is we have no idea what rosters will look like next season for a lot of teams, especially those on the older end of spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
