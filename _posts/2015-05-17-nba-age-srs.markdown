I saw a chart a while back comparing beisbol teams' expected win totals to their team ages. The idea was to find:

* teams who were expected to lose a ton of games and it would be OK because they are young and "up and coming".
* teams who were expected to lose a ton of games and it's a huge problem because they're old and getting older.
* teams who were expected to win a lot of games and damn well better because they, too, are old and it is now or never.
* teams who were expected to win a lot of games and should continue to do so for a while with a young core.
* a bunch of other teams in less extreme situations. 

So that had me wondering what a similar look at the NBA might show. As a Warriors fan, I've spent this season hearing a lot of talk about how the Dubs are set up for long term success with a yound core of players. This sort of optimism is completely foreign to me, and so I spent the season looking for reasons why this nonsense. This chart does not do that.

The <a href= 'http://www.basketball-reference.com/blog/?p=39' target = '_blank'>SRS</a> is simply taken from the teams' regular season performance as calculated by basketball-reference.com. The age of each team is a weighted average based on players' minutes played during the regular season.
