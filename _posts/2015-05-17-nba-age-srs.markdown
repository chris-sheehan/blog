I saw a chart a while back comparing beisbol teams' expected win totals to their team ages. The idea was to find:

* teams who were expected to lose a ton of games and it would be OK because they are young and "up and coming".
* teams who were expected to lose a ton of games and it's a huge problem because they're old and getting older.
* teams who were expected to win a lot of games and damn well better because they, too, are old and it is now or never.
* teams who were expected to win a lot of games and should continue to do so for a while with a young core.
* a bunch of other teams in less extreme situations. 

So that had me wondering what a similar look at the NBA might show. As a Golden State Warriors fan, I've spent this season hearing a lot of talk about how the Dubs are set up for long term success with a young core of players. This sort of optimism is completely foreign to me, and so I spent the season looking for reasons why this nonsense. This chart does not do that. (Playoff teams in red)

The <a href= 'http://www.basketball-reference.com/blog/?p=39' target = '_blank'>SRS</a> is simply taken from the teams' regular season performance as calculated by basketball-reference.com. The age of each team is a weighted average based on players' minutes played during the regular season. A few stray observations:

* The Warriors do look to be a position to capitalize in a young core.
* The Utah Jazz are the only team with a positive SRS whose age is < 25, and they clear it with ease at 23.4.
* Some really bad teams on the older side (Lakers and Knicks) are somewhat misleading as they tanked hard all year, both with a number of older players who won't be on the roster 2015-16.
* Somehow, I'm not terribly worried the Spurs, despite being the second oldest team in the league; I would be considerably more worried about the Clippers if I cared about LA sports.

Obviously, the qualifier attached to all of this is we have no idea what rosters will look like next season for a lot of teams, especially those on the older end of spectrum.
