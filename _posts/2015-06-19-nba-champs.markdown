No posts for the past month while I was buried under the NBA playoffs. Now that the Warriors are NBA champions, there's only one thing to do: run the numbers.

Lots of talk during the last three games of the series about the Warriors "going small" and how it was a bold decision by Kerr. That got me wondering how small the Warriors actually went, and whether it was actually all that bold.

Weighted for playing time, the Warriors average height in the finals was 78.6". That _does_ put them on the shorter side of history, specifically being the 12th shortest team to win a title since 1975, the last time the Warriors won the title. Interesting notes about those eleven teams ahead of them:

* Eight of them won the title in 1990 or earlier. Surely with the bigger, faster players in the league in 2015, the Warriors' success with a small lineup is more impressive (and unusual)...
* But maybe not... the other three teams ahead of them are 2014 San Antonio Spurs, and the 2012 and 2013 Miami Heat. It appears that "small ball" may have been out of vogue for a period in the 90s, but has seen a resurgance lately.

Given the latter point, I'm not so sure "going small" was terribly bold, or even unusual.


What is interesting is the age of this Warriors team. Weighted for minutes played, this was the fourth youngest championship in NBA history, and the youngest in 35 years.
